title: The Magic
---


A monotonic, lonely life in a city full of opportunities. The loop of bed to desk, then the couch, and then bed again. Waiting for something to happen. Endless, meaningless swiping on the dating app hoping to match with someone. Until you meet with her, the Magic.

An await is over. The conversation is smoother than butter. The excitement, the energy, the zest of life, are back. Everything around you feels only more beautiful. You see her in the songs, keep thinking about her, can't stop talking about her to your friends. The smile every time she texts you back, lengthy-long messages pouring in your thoughts and soul. It feels unreal.

Then comes the date. Two perfect cups of coffee, stormy weather, a cozy spot next to a window, and most importantly, her. The prettiest her. Now you feel the Magic. With no space for drama and judging. Just two people who are genuinely there to know each other. You talk about passions. Real insecurities. Childhood. Trauma. Curiosities. The interest in her eyes, the questions she asks back. It’s no more a conversation, it’s a confession. The sentences are so simple and deep at the same time. She reminds you of yourself. No thinking, no filter, like you are talking to yourself. That is the Magic. 

All this within just a week of meeting her. You question if this is a delusion or an imagination in your head. Scared of losing this Magic if you lose her. Until finally, you realize, the Magic has been everywhere. It has been around you, within you all along. Making you realize, you are enough. You, the amazing, beautiful you. You are the Magic.
