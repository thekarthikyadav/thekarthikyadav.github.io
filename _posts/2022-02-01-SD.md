A new city. My new home. The calmness. Cloudless blue sky. The golden sun rays over the blue ocean. The cold breeze with sunny sun making you questiuon whether you need a jacket or not. Surfers trying to ride each wave in style. Dogs being their happiest running around.

A place where the sunsets has healing powers. A place where a beach doesn't need music. A place where all I want to do is write and not worry about anything. A place where every photograph of nature feels like a painting, a scenery, something out of a movie. A place you want to wake up early just to have more sun. 

The aura reflects in the people here. The calmness of the city can be as the patience. The cold breeze gives a gist of how social and chill people are. The golden sun. The smiley smiles. Blue cloudless sky. Nicest hearts. A new city. The old happiest me.
