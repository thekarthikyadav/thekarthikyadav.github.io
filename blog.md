It’s weird writing this title. Yep. It’s 2022 already. I still feel like I am stuck in 2018 or 2019. Sometimes I wish I could go back there and sometimes, I don’t. Coming into this year, I am 25. I don’t feel not even an ounce bit ready being called as 25. So, you know what, I cannot control it anyway so, I am just gonna let it be. I am 25? Alright. I will take it. 

Sitting in this empty lounge on the 5th floor of the Grad housing, doesn’t feel as weird as it would. I feel tired though. Mentally. Physically. But I haven’t done anything. I don’t feel the same zest in myself trying to do new things. Trying to meet people. Maybe it’s a part of getting old. You want to have deeper connections. You want to chill and know yourself better. It is about getting to know a place different ways than exploring a new place. Nah, that’s comfort zone. Fuck that.

Coming to the elephant in the room. Moving to the US. Yep. It’s been 4 months now. It actually feels a lot longer. Maybe it’s cuz so much has happened. So far, I love it. In a way. I got I wanted though. I came in with fear, anxiety and a head full of questions. But so far, I did what I wanted academically. I put my time and energy into classes, internship search and making this my place. I have done that. Now, for the real part. The part which I love the most.

I want to spend this year on myself (like every freaking year) and family. First, spend more time on having better mental and physical health. I gotta meditate, eat good food and exercise. See the sun more. Spend more time at the beach writing and reading than playing Dota or watching some dumb tv.

I want to spend time being a more social person. Get comfortable saying hello to a stranger and gathering the courage to ask someone out. Just be myself and see who will stick around me. No dwelling in the past. No thinking if I am good enough. I am enough and I know it. This is the present and I am gonna to do the thing which I want to do. LFG. 

I want to spend time with family. It’s been over 3 years since I have been home. One more year and it’s been a freaking undergrad. It is my mistake and also the things which aren’t in my control. But yeah, I will spend time understanding my parents better, supporting my brother wherever I can. And most of all, head home for a vacation. I miss India now more than ever.

I want to spend time being proactive. Doing things than thinking. Making stuff happen not waiting for it to happen. Making a new product, work on new projects. Publish them and show them to friends. This is what I want to do. Not have pages of writing in my yellow rough notes nowhere to be seen. We think so much and feel so little. I want to change that. 

Last but not the least, I want to have a fearless time. I spend days and weeks filled with comfort zone, pressure, crippling anxiety and overthinking. I want to put an end to this, or actually learn to handle them better. That will be the biggest achievement I ever want to do.
