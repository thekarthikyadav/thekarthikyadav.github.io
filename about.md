Well, hello there! Welcome to my little corner in the internet. I am Karthik, currently living in San Diego. I am passionate about writing, stand-up comedy, working out, cooking and programming. I love using everyday objects for motivation to write and create something cool from them.

I did my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. I also did Software Internships at Facebook and Amazon.
